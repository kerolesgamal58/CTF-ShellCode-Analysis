# ShellCode Simplified: A Journey into Shellcode Analysis

I recently had solved a CTF challenge on CyberDefeners, and I can't wait to share my writeup with all of you. ðŸš€âœ¨

While I was solving the CTF I faced a ShellCode which is part of an exploit used to exploit a vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 :bomb:. This vulnerability is found in many Microsoft office products in different versions.

So, after completing the challenge I tried to read the ShellCode myself and understand what it's doing and found that it's better to share my analysis to help anyone trying to read the ShellCode himself/herself. I hope you enjoy it :smiley:
